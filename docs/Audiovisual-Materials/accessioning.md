Accessioning includes actions to examine, stabilize, and document information about a collection upon receipt to establish administrative control. Like born digital materials, this means an enhanced approach to accessioning is required. As part of accessioning procedures for audiovisual materials, the Digital Archivist or authorized person will document audiovisual media at as close to the item level as possible. The act of prioritization for digitization involves actions related to the process of appraisal, and the usually discrete actions of accessioning and appraisal are combined in a single step for audiovisual materials to minimize the repeated handling of materials.  

Accessioning materials at this level allows archivists to determine the full cost of processing for materials that can be handled in-house and communicate the costs of reformatting for materials that cannot be handled in-house to donors, administrators, and curators.  

The steps in this section assume that the materials have been formally accepted into the archive by an authorized agent within the WVRHC, that a Deed of Gift, Deed of Loan, or transfer form has been completed, and that an accession record with an associated accession number has been created in ArchivesSpace. Any donor restrictions regarding collection content or expectations regarding the usage of digital materials should be communicated at the point of accession. 

For collections with fewer than ten audiovisual items, audiovisual materials will be flagged by the Accessioning Archivist as part of accessioning procedures using the Reformatting Request Form (accessible to WVRHC employees only but shared in [Appendix 2](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/docs/Appendices/appendix2/#reformatting-request-form)). The Digital Archivist will complete the [Audiovisual Media Inventory Spreadsheet](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/assets/files/AudiovisualMediaInventoryTemplate.xlsx) for collections of this size. For collections with more than ten audiovisual items, the Accessioning Archivist or a designee should complete an [Audiovisual Media Inventory Spreadsheet](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/assets/files/AudiovisualMediaInventoryTemplate.xlsx) prior to submitting the Reformatting Request Form (accessible to WVRHC employees only but shared in [Appendix 2](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/docs/Appendices/appendix2/#reformatting-request-form)). The spreadsheet can be uploaded as part of the Reformatting Request Form (accessible to WVRHC employees only but shared in [Appendix 2](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/docs/Appendices/appendix2/#reformatting-request-form)). See the bulleted list after the next paragraph for a description of the spreadsheet. Once the form is submitted and the submission is noted in the General Note of the Accession Record by the Accessioning Archivist, the Digital Archivist will add the collection and inventory to the Digital Archives Work Tasks board (accessible to WVRHC employees only but shared in [Appendix 2](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/docs/Appendices/appendix2/#digital-archives-work-tasks-board)), which records digital archives work, including any queued inventories and digitization. If an item is pulled for accessioning, a [Removal Sheet](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/assets/files/RemovalSheet.docx) will be completed, with one half of the sheet stored in the item’s original location and the other half of the sheet stored with the item.         

As part of the accessioning process, an [Audiovisual Media Inventory Spreadsheet](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/assets/files/AudiovisualMediaInventoryTemplate.xlsx) will be completed for each collection with audiovisual materials. Upon completion of an inventory spreadsheet, an Inventory note will be added to the Accession Record for a collection in ArchivesSpace by the individual completing the inventory. This spreadsheet will be saved in the Administration folder in the collection folder created in the previous paragraph. The [Audiovisual Media Inventory Spreadsheet](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/assets/files/AudiovisualMediaInventoryTemplate.xlsx) will include the following: 

- Person Completing Inventory 
    - Name of person completing inventory. 
- Date of Inventory 
    - Date person is completing the inventory. 
- Accession Number	 
    - Accession number for materials being inventoried. 
- Box Number	 
    - The box number for the box from which the item originated.  
- Identifier	 
    - For the identifier within a Media Inventory Spreadsheet, materials are identified with a unique alpha-numeric code. To name an audiovisual object, use the collection number, the appropriate format abbreviation from the list below, and a number in sequential order. The example code 4050_vhs_0043 indicates that the item is from collection A&M 4050 and is the 43rd VHS processed in the collection. If the format isn’t present in the below list, contact the Digital Archivist.

- Label/Title
    - Transcription of written content on the physical media that can be used as a title. If the title is overly lengthy or if it, for example, includes a track list write that in the description field. 
    - If there is no label on the media, use the identifier as the title.  
- Date (YYYY-MM-DD)	 
    - Any date information present on the physical media. 
- Description	 
    - Additional information that is too lengthy for the Label/Title field. Include a transcription for information that is written on the media itself if feasible. Note other information such as the presence of a written inventory or other physical materials documenting the content of the media. Do not transcribe these latter types of notes; simply note their presence. 
- Format	
    - Format of the item.
- Diameter, Extent, or Length
    - Value(s) describing the extent of the item 
- Condition Issues	 
    - Any issues, such as damage or missing parts, with the physical media. 
- Notes 
    - Other information related to actions taken by the person conducting the inventory or information that does not fit in any of the previous fields.  
- Technical/Format Risk (to be completed by the Digital Archivist or authorized representative)
- Research Value (to be completed by the Digital Archivist or authorized representative)
- Rarity (to be completed by the Digital Archivist or authorized representative)

This inventory, once completed, will be extended by the Digital Archivist in coordination with the Archives and Manuscript unit head to appraise and prioritize for digitization materials based on the format, anticipated research value, and condition of the materials using information available about the item(s) prior to playing back the materials. Widely available commercial materials, such as those published for widespread national use, are excluded from this prioritization. These materials will not be digitized and should be deaccessioned where donor restrictions allow.  

Materials must be labeled with the identifier assigned in the [Audiovisual Media Inventory Spreadsheet](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/assets/files/AudiovisualMediaInventoryTemplate.xlsx). Depending on the format and available supplies, labelling may include materials being foldered with the identifier written on the folder or by writing directly on the container for the item in pencil (never the original item unless the original item includes a label). A sticky note may be used only if the adhesive is not in contact with the media item. 

The Digital Archivist will create the directory structure for the accession to house the content on the media and relevant documentation that will be needed as part of processing. This structure, when fully implemented, adheres to the OAIS AIP standard. If working with materials from a processed collection, the directory structure should be added to Z:\A&M\ with the top level folder named with the A&M number. If working with materials from an unprocessed collection that only has an accession number, save the materials in Z:\Working Files\Backlog\ with the top level folder named with the accession number. An empty version of this file structure can be copied from Z:\Working Files\Resources_For_Born_Digital_Processing\TemplateAccessioningFileStructure to the appropriate location. Remove irrelevant folders and documents from the template where applicable. 

The output of appraisal will consist of a total numeric score from 0-9, with each factor outlined below being given a rating from 1-3. Appraisal for audiovisual materials may be conducted at the item, series, or collection level as appropriate for the type of materials. For instance, homogenous materials of the same format and subject in a collection may be appraised together. Higher totals indicate a higher priority for digitization. The following criteria and ranking system is substantially based on Indiana University’s MediaRIVERS (Media Research and Instructional Value Evaluation and Ranking System).  

- Technical/format risk – The format of an audiovisual item can indicate who the original user was, the likelihood of uniqueness of an item, and the risk level of an item. 
    - 3 (highest risk): These media formats are nearing their "end of life", that is, the period in which content on the media will be able to be retrieved accurately and completely. This rating is "highest risk." Formats given this rating include:  
        - U-matic 
        - Acetate / lacquer disc 
        - Betamax  
        - 16mm film 
        - Super 8 
        - Materials of all formats with significant damage 
    - 2: These media formats are higher risk but less critical. This rating is "high risk." Those formats include: 
        - 1/4-inch audio tape 
        - VHS 
        - Microcassette 
        - Minicassette 
    - 1: These formats are at a moderate risk for loss. This rating is "moderate risk." Formats given this rating include:   
        - Compact audio cassette 
        - Betacam 
        - Optical media (CDs, DVDs) 
        - Digital Audio Tape (DAT) 
    - 0 (lowest risk): These formats are at little risk of loss. This rating is "low risk." 
        - 78 rpm records 
        - 12-inch LP 
        - 7-inch single 
- Research value – Does the item document a subject of high research or user interest based on the WVRHC’s collecting policy?   
    - 3 (highest value): The materials document a topic of high research value at the WVRHC. 
    - 2: The materials document a topic that is of moderate research value at the WVRHC. 
    - 1: The materials document a topic that is of low research value at the WVRHC. 
    - 0 (lowest value): The materials document a topic that is not of high research value at the WVRHC. 
- Rarity – Is the item unique in what it documents?  Can similar materials be found elsewhere in other collecting institutions? Does the item document an area of history that historically been underdocumented within the WVRHC? 
    - 3 (highest value): Only a handful of institutions have content on this topic. 
    - 2: Some content is available elsewhere.  
    - 1: Content can be found elsewhere.  
    - 0 (lowest value): Content is widely available.  

Higher scores indicate a more immediate need to address the preservation concerns of the materials. The below ranges can be used for reference: 
    - 8-9 - Extreme danger—digitize ASAP (realistically within 2 years) 
    - 6-7 - Danger ahead—digitize within 2-5 years 
    - 4-5 - Caution, moderate risk—digitize within 5-7 years  
    - 0-3 - Lowest priority, digitize within 10-15 years  

Ultimately, it is an unfortunate reality that some content will be lost before materials can be reformatted due to inadequate staffing and resource levels. Prioritization allows us to address the content most in need as funding and time are available.  

Note: unlabeled or poorly labeled items are more difficult to assess research value with any accuracy. Media with these issues require audio or video playback to accurately describe for patron use, an activity that is time consuming and in opposition to the more product, less process approach to processing undertaken by the WVRHC. These materials will fall lower on the prioritization scale unless requested by a patron. Items requested by a patron will be digitized immediately where possible based on the equipment available for in-house digitization outlined in the [Supported Formats and Equipment](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/docs/Reformatting-And-Digitizing-Materials/supported-formats-and-equipment/) section and an assessment of the original item’s suitability for in-house digitization. Other materials will be digitized by an external vendor based on the willingness of the requestor.
