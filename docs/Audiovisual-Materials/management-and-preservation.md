# Management and Preservation

An annual assessment of the material at the highest level of risk will be conducted by the Digital Archivist to determine whether there is funding, internal or external, available to digitize those materials in-house or by a vendor. Recommendations for addressing this material will be included in the assessment. This assessment will be shared with WVRHC administration and WVU Libraries administration as an advocacy tool.    

Long term management and preservation of digitized materials will fall under the procedures outlined in the [Digital Preservation Administration](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/digital-preservation-administration) section.
