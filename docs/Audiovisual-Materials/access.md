# Access

Some materials that have not been digitized yet may be requested through a request for materials to use in the reading room or a request for digitization for remote use. Original audiovisual materials may not be played back in the reading room. If these materials can be digitized in-house (see the [Supported Formats and Equipment](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/docs/Reformatting-And-Digitizing-Materials/supported-formats-and-equipment/) section for a complete listing of equipment available for in-house digitization and supported formats), a reference staff member or the Photographs Manager must submit a Reformatting Request Form (accessible to WVRHC employees only but shared in [Appendix 2](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/docs/Appendices/appendix2/#reformatting-request-form)) for the item, being sure to indicate that the item is a patron request. These materials will then follow the instructions outlined in the [Planned, In-House Digitization](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/docs/Reformatting-And-Digitizing-Materials/digitization-workflows/) section. Materials in the digital repository will be linked to the original material described in ArchivesSpace and vice versa. 

Some materials may not be able to be digitized in- house based on format or condition. For materials that cannot be digitized in-house, the Digital Archivist will convey an approximate timeline and estimate of cost through an external vendor for digitizing the materials to the requestor. 

Digitized audiovisual materials in collections will, by default, be made accessible to varying degrees via the digital repository based on copyright, privacy, legal, and donor considerations. Given those considerations, digital materials may be made freely available via the digital repository if:  

- The materials are in the public domain (be it through expiration of copyright or Creative Commons Licensing on behalf of the donor) 
- Permission is secured from the copyright holder 
- Copyright has been transferred to the WVRHC 
- Materials may be made accessible via Section 108 of copyright law 
- The items have no determinable copyright holder and the works are "orphaned" 
    - Copyright evaluations for materials determined to be "orphaned" should be saved on the Z: drive in the folder for a collection. Copyright evaluations should be conducted by the Digital Archivist or an authorized entity. 

Materials will only be made available to all individuals who are logged in to the repository and have completed a digital content usage agreement if:  

- The materials are under copyright and no Section 108 exemption supporting open access applies 
- The materials required significant redaction  
- The deed of gift or other documentation related to the acquisition of the materials is unclear about whether the WVRHC has permission to make these materials widely digitally available 

Materials will only be made available to specific individuals who are logged in to the repository, have completed a digital content usage agreement, and have completed any other relevant forms if: 

- The materials are restricted and require additional special permissions based on donor agreements 

Materials will be made available on-site if:  

- The materials are redacted in the digital repository and the original is requested 
- Users would like to view materials that require a log-in to the repository 
- Donor or copyright restrictions require in-person only access 

## On-Site Only Access 

For on-site access, reference staff should contact the Digital Archivist with the ArchivesSpace link to the materials being requested and the date the patron would like to use the materials.  

*Materials will be made accessible using the reading room computer. Additional details to come pending discussions with Systems Infrastructure.*
