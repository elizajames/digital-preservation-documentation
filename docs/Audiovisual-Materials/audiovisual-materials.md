## Introduction

Like born digital materials, audiovisual materials are also subject to degradation in ways that most paper-based materials are not and require additional measures beyond the usual degree required for working with analog materials. Basic preservation actions for audiovisual materials almost always require digitization, a time-consuming task as audiovisual materials can only be digitized in real time. Audiovisual materials are often underutilized due to a lack of description, or insufficient resources in staffing, equipment, and technology to make access copies readily available. Older formats are fragile, with short life spans, and a single use may inadvertently damage them. 

Though the process of accessioning this type of media seemingly only applies to new collections that are being accessioned for the first time, audiovisual materials may be found in existing processed collections that were never formally accessioned and processed according to current standards. These legacy materials must also undergo the same processes outlined in this section.
