## Digital Repository Metadata Profile

The WVRHC seeks to emphasize interoperable and shareable metadata. As such, the WVRHC adheres to the metadata standard created by the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) and adapted by Digital Virginias, WVU’s regional DPLA hub when adding metadata describing digital objects to a digital repository. The following metadata application profile outlines the metadata field definitions as well as which fields are required and optional fields for use within the department’s digital content management system for providing access to digital materials. Bolded values indicate that a field is required. Additional information about specific field usage can be found on the [Digital Virginias website](https://digitalvirginias.org/metadata/). These fields may be used at the item, folder, series, or collection level within the digital repository.
