## National Digital Stewardship Alliance (NDSA) Levels of Digital Preservation 

The [NDSA Levels of Digital Preservation](https://ndsa.org/publications/levels-of-digital-preservation/) is broken down into five functional areas and four levels, with each level indicating specific actions for storage, integrity, control, metadata, and content considerations. Adherence to the levels is indicated by green, yellow, and red highlighted notes. Green indicates adherence, yellow indicates in-progress work toward adherence, and red indicates work toward that item has not yet begun. 

### Level 1 â€“ Know your content

Content flagged is quarantined and monitored by the Digital Archivist before being uploaded to secure storage.                                                                                   |
|     Control            |   Determine the human and software agents that should be authorized to read, write, move, and delete content       |   A permissions document consolidates who has read and write (including move and delete) permissions. The Digital Archivist authorizes the use permissions given to new users.                                                                                                                           |

Storage locations are isolated to a single location: the Z: drive.                                                                                                                                     |
|     Metadata           |   Backup inventory and store at least one copy separately from content                                             |   An inventory of storage media, not necessarily a detailed listing of the files contained on that media (pending processing level), is in ArchivesSpace. A detailed inventory of file-level information is currently not stored separately from content, but options are being examined as of 10/2022.  |
|     Content            |   Document file formats and other essential content characteristics including how and when these were identified   |   File formats and characteristics are generated using siegfried and are stored in a metadata folder with the content. The date is stored as part of the brunnhilde report generated at the same time.                                                                                                   |
