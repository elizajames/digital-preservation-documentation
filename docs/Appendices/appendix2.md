[Removal Sheet](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/assets/files/RemovalSheet.docx)
- Form to manage and track the location of materials removed from a collection for reformatting.  

## Reformatting Request Form
This form is used internally at the WVRHC to flag materials for reformatting and tracking by the Digital Archivist. Materials to be flagged for reformatting include born digital media and analog audiovisual materials as well as serving as a way of nominating materials for "traditional" digitization of 2-D items that WVRHC employees think merit inclusion in the digital repository. Ideally, for incoming collections, this form is used during accessioning, but this form might also be used during processing as materials are encountered. For reference, this form includes the following fields: 

- Collection identifier
- Location within collection of materials
- Any additional description
- Optional file upload for inventories of materials
- Format of materials
    - 2-D Material (papers, photographs/negatives, and flat items broadly defined)
    - Audio and Video Tapes, Discs, and Reels (VHS, 8mm or 16mm film, Betamax, vinyl records, etc)
    - Digital Media (CD/DVDs, USBs, floppy disks, hard drives, etc)
    - 3-D Objects
    - Other
- Reason for reformatting
    - Preservation issues (for materials that are fragile and may be harmed if a patron uses them)
    - Materials are being used for exhibit or display
    - Access issues (for materials that cannot be read and used by a researcher in their current format)
    - Subject matter of materials is underrepresented in current online collections (ex: Black history, history of women, LGBTQ+ history, related activism, etc.)
    - Material has high potential for research use in an online setting
    - Researcher request (for preservation quality digitization)
    - Teaching
    - Other
- Relevant deadlines for reformatting
- Person who needs to be notified once reformatting is completed
- Person who needs to receive a copy of the submitted form

## Digital Archives Work Tasks Board
This board is used internally at the WVRHC primarily by the Digital Archivist to track reformatting work for all formats. The software used is Microsoft Lists (similar to a very simplified version of AirTable) embedded into a Microsoft Team and supports comments, attachments, filtering, etc. It is shared with processing staff. For reference, the fields included are as follows: 
- Work item - typically collection identifier and title
- Description - description of work to be done, formats, locations, etc. 
- Category - controlled list
    - Born digital processing
    - Audiovisual processing
    - Digitization 
    - Digital repository
    - Digital preservation
- Progress - controlled list
    - Not started
    - In progress
    - Completed
    - Blocked
- Priority - controlled list
    - Low 
    - Medium
    - High 
    - Critical
- Assigned to - person working on the task
- Date added - date an item was added to the list
- Due date - date an item is due
- Completion date - date an item was completed 
- Notes - anything else that doesn't fit elsewhere
