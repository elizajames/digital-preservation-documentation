Management, including potential or proposed modification or addition, of materials already packaged into Archival Information Packages for long term storage or materials that have been accessioned or are being processed should be done in consultation with the Digital Archivist and recorded in the PREMIS Spreadsheet for the collection. 

Long term preservation of born digital materials is covered in the [Digital Preservation Administration](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/digital-preservation-administration) section.  

The Digital Archivist will track unsupported born digital formats through an annual assessment of the materials to determine whether there is funding, internal or external, available to support content extraction from those materials in-house or by a vendor. Recommendations for addressing this material will be included in the assessment. This assessment will be shared with WVRHC administration and WVU Libraries administration as an advocacy tool.
