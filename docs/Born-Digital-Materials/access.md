## Introduction

The WVRHC emphasizes making materials as accessible as possible given privacy, legal, ethical, cultural, copyright, and other relevant considerations. The WVRHC upholds the privacy and safety of individuals who create or are mentioned in the archival collections it holds. Materials with private and personally identifiable information will be redacted in the digital repository with original files accessible on-site only. Access is primarily supported through the digital repository unless restrictions require on-site access only. Materials in the digital repository will be linked to the original material described in ArchivesSpace and vice versa.  

Born digital materials in collections will be made accessible to varying degrees via the digital repository based on copyright, privacy, legal, and donor considerations. Given those considerations, digital materials may be made freely available via the digital repository if:  

- The materials are in the public domain (be it through expiration of copyright or Creative Commons Licensing on behalf of the donor) 
- Permission is secured from the copyright holder 
- Copyright has been transferred to the WVRHC 
- Materials may be made accessible via Section 108 of copyright law 
- The items have no determinable copyright holder and the works are "orphaned"
    - Copyright evaluations for materials determined to be "orphaned" should be saved on the Z: drive in the Administration folder for a collection. Copyright evaluations should be conducted by the Digital Archivist or an authorized entity. 

Materials will only be made available to all individuals who are logged in to the repository and have completed a digital content usage agreement if:  

- The materials are under copyright and no Section 108 exemption supporting open access applies 
- The materials required significant redaction  
- The deed of gift or other documentation related to the acquisition of the materials is unclear about whether the WVRHC has permission to make these materials widely digitally available 

Materials will only be made available to specific individuals who are logged in to the repository, have completed a digital content usage agreement, and have completed any other relevant forms if: 

- The materials are restricted and require additional special permissions based on donor agreements 

Materials will be made available on-site if:  

- The materials cannot be redacted or uploaded to the digital repository 
- The materials are redacted in the digital repository and the original is requested 
- Users would like to view materials that require a log-in to the repository 
- Donor or copyright restrictions require in-person only access 

## On-Site Only Access 

For on-site access, reference staff should contact the Digital Archivist with the ArchivesSpace link to the materials being requested and the date the patron would like to use the materials.  

*Materials will be made accessible using the reading room computer. Additional details to come pending discussions with Systems Infrastructure.*

## Troubleshooting File Formats

If you are having issues opening a file you would like to view: 

- Search [PRONOM](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/Default.aspx) to get additional information about the history of the format, such as file systems and original software, that might be useful in researching modern or emulated options for viewing the software.  
- Search the Library of Congress resource [Sustainability of Digital Formats](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/browse_list.shtml) for additional in-depth information.  
- A more comprehensive list of file extensions with minimal information but links to other file format registries can be found on [All known extensions](http://www.digipres.org/formats/extensions/).
