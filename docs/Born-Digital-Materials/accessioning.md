# Accessioning Overview 

Accessioning includes actions to examine, stabilize, and document information about a collection upon receipt to establish administrative control. Born digital materials are particularly subject to degradation and require additional measures beyond the usual degree required for accessioning analog materials. Because born digital materials are not inherently “browsable” in their base state, content must be mounted on a computer and copied to the Z: drive in preparation for appraisal and processing. As part of accessioning procedures for digital materials, the Digital Archivist or authorized person will document digital media or remote file transfers and move files and any relevant documentation into a working directory in preparation for future processing. The result of the accessioning process is the creation of a Submission Information Package, or SIP, as outlined in the OAIS reference model. 

The steps in this section assume that the materials have been formally accepted into the archive by an authorized agent within the WVRHC, that a Deed of Gift has been completed, and that an accession record with an associated accession number has been created in ArchivesSpace. Digital materials will be flagged by the Accessioning Archivist as part of standard accessioning procedures using the Reformatting Request Form (accessible to WVRHC employees only but shared in [Appendix 2](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/docs/Appendices/appendix2/reformatting-request-form)). Once the form is submitted, the Digital Archivist will add the materials to the Digital Archives Work Tasks board (accessible to WVRHC employees only).  

Though the process of accessioning media seemingly only applies to new collections that are being accessioned for the first time, born digital media may be found in existing processed collections that were never formally accessioned and processed according to current standards. These legacy materials must also undergo the same processes outlined in this section.  

Any donor restrictions regarding collection content or expectations regarding the usage of digital materials should be communicated at the point of accession.
