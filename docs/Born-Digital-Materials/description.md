Description may be done in tandem with processing but should always be completed at a minimum after processing activities are completed. Description for born digital materials should be consistent with the Archives & Manuscripts unit style guide, including approaches to reparative and inclusive description and other descriptive policies.  

The Information Package being described as part of the description process is the AIP, not the DIP, though information about how the DIP differs from the AIP needs to be included in the Conditions Governing Access field. For disk images, the DIP is what is being described though the AIP, i.e. the disk image, is what is being preserved. All description work must be completed on a copy of the files to mitigate the possibility of modifying the original files. For small collections of materials, copying the materials to the processor’s desktop should be sufficient. For larger collections, contact the Digital Archivist for a drive containing the materials that can be used for description. 

The [Born Digital Processing Spreadsheet](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/assets/files/BornDigitalProcessingSpreadsheet.xlsx) will be used to organize information for a collection in preparation for batch upload to ArchivesSpace or simply to coordinate descriptive information for manual input. A blank version of the file should already be present in the Administration folder for a collection.  

Open the [Born Digital Processing Spreadsheet](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/assets/files/BornDigitalProcessingSpreadsheet.xlsx), the copy of the files, the Brunnhilde reports for the processed collection, other donor and collection documentation, and the [PREMIS Spreadsheet](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/assets/files/PREMISSpreadsheet.xlsx) for the collection, the last of which contains a record of all actions conducted during processing. Open the [PREMIS Spreadsheet](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/assets/files/PREMISSpreadsheet.xlsx) for the collection and review the Appraisal events. Follow the general set of actions for each level outlined in the following table:

|     Minimal                                |   The descriptive level for media items is File not Item. This is because born digital media items contain multiple files/items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |   Create Collection level description and Series level description (if applicable).  Create File level description for each media item in the [Born Digital Processing Spreadsheet](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/assets/files/BornDigitalProcessingSpreadsheet.xlsx). Consult the [ArchivesSpace Metadata](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/docs/Born-Digital-Materials/description/#archivesSpace-metadata) section for required metadata and help generating and structuring metadata according to standards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|     Enhanced                               |   The descriptive level for media items is File. The descriptive level for folders in media items is File for folders because they also contain multiple files/items. Note: folders within a media item can be nested within other folders, but we will typically only create an archival object for the highest level of folder and use the scope and contents note to describe the nested contents of a folder unless there is significant user benefit otherwise.   |   Create Collection level description and Series level description (if applicable).  Create File level description for each media item and top and lower level (if applicable) folders in the [Born Digital Processing Spreadsheet](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/assets/files/BornDigitalProcessingSpreadsheet.xlsx). Top level folders should be nested one level “down” from the media item description. Additional nesting should follow the directory structure in the media item. Consult the [ArchivesSpace Metadata](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/docs/Born-Digital-Materials/description/#archivesSpace-metadata) section for required metadata and help generating and structuring metadata according to standards.                                                                                                  |
|     Intensive                              |   The descriptive level for media items is File. The descriptive level for folders in media items is File. The descriptive level for individual files is Item.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |   Create Collection level description and Series level description (if applicable).  Create File level description for each media item and top-level folders in each media item. Top level folders should be nested one level “down” from the media item description. Additional nesting, including for individual files/items, should follow the directory structure in the media item.  Create Item level description for each file on the media item in the [Born Digital Processing Spreadsheet](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/assets/files/BornDigitalProcessingSpreadsheet.xlsx). Consult the ArchivesSpace Metadata section for required metadata and help generating and structuring metadata according to standards.  |

If a full file or folder list is necessary for Enhanced or Intensive processing, use the siegfried.csv file (useful purely for file lists) or [WizTree Instructions](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/docs/Born-Digital-Materials/description/#wiztree-instructions) (useful for combined folder and file lists, including size and number of files) to generate a file list for use in the upload.  

Once metadata creation in the [Born Digital Processing Spreadsheet](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/assets/files/BornDigitalProcessingSpreadsheet.xlsx) is complete, create ArchivesSpace archival objects (which correspond to the processing level) as part of the resource record. This may be done easily using the bulk upload process for large quantities of objects. Follow the [information on the ArchivesSpace Help Center](https://archivesspace.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ArchivesSpaceUserManual/pages/1173913646/Import+Archival+Objects+from+Excel+or+CSV+File+from+v2.8.1) (account and ArchivesSpace membership needed) to bulk upload. Send the ArchivesSpace link for the draft, unpublished finding aid to the Accessioning Archivist and/or Head of Archives and Manuscripts pending availability. For hybrid collections, send a copy of the Born Digital Processing Spreadsheet for the collection. Revise the finding aid in response to Accessioning Archivist and/or Head of Archives and Manuscripts feedback.  

Repeat the submission and revision process until finding aid is approved. Publish the finding aid once the finding aid has been approved by the Accessioning Archivist and/or Head of Archives and Manuscripts. Accessioning Archivist and/or Head of Archives and Manuscripts will contact the donor or complete a press release if relevant for the collection based on donor wishes and department priorities.   

## ArchivesSpace Metadata

At the collection and series level, the following information should be used for fully born digital collections. For hybrid collections, defer to the A&M Processing Manual, but be sure to incorporate the following fields outlined here for born digital description: Conditions Governing Access, Conditions Governing Use, Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements, System of Arrangement, and Processing Information:

In addition to the standard archival objects created in ArchivesSpace as part of all archival processing activities, digital archival materials with accessible content (i.e. content must have been retrievable off of the media item) also require digital objects be associated with each archival object that has digital materials. Digital objects may represent a single file, many files, or files in complex multi-level structures. Digital objects should be associated at the file level (I.e. at the media item level) unless more granular access is supported. In the rare case item level information is present, digital objects should be associated at the item level. 

To manually create a digital object in ArchivesSpace attached to the existing archival object for the item, use following instructions: 

1. Navigate to the appropriate Resource record for the collection and Archival Object (folder or item).  
2. Click Edit.  
3. Under Instances, click “Add Digital Object.” 
4. In the Digital Object tab, click “Create.”  
5. In the Digital Object screen, enter the following:  
    * Title: use the same title as the Archival Object 
    * Identifier: Use the identifier for the item (e.g., 4050_disc_001) 
    * Conditions Governing Access: Researchers may access born digital materials by requesting to view the materials in person by appointment or remotely by contacting the West Virginia & Regional History Center reference department at wvrhcref@mail.wvu.edu. (This is for temporary use until we get a digital repository up and running)  
    * Extent:  
        * Portion, select: Whole 
        * Number: Numeric value for quantity of files in GB 
        * Type, select: Gigabytes 
        * Container Summary: format as “1,000 files”, using the number of files for the applicable item 
    * Digital Object Type: choose the appropriate type from the fixed menu 
    * Language: choose the correct language 
    * Date information includes:  
        * Expression, formatted as: YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM, YYYY, undated, or YYYY-YYYY 
        * Date Type, select: Single or Inclusive 
            * For inclusive date types, fill in Begin (the beginning date) and End (the end date) 
        * Label, select: Creation 
    * Agent Links: link the appropriate agent and role (usually creator) 
    * *File Versions – TBD, waiting on digital repository, would support thumbnails etc*
6. Click Save.
