Description may be done in tandem with processing but should always be completed as soon as possible after processing activities are completed to minimize loss in knowledge of processing actions.Description for born digital materials should be consistent with the Archives & Manuscripts unit style guide, including approaches to reparative and inclusive description and other descriptive policies.  

The Information Package being described as part of the description process is the AIP, not the DIP, though information about how the DIP differs from the AIP needs to be included in the Conditions Governing Access field. For disk images, the DIP is what is being described though the AIP, i.e. the disk image, is what is being preserved. All description work must be completed on a copy of the files to mitigate the possibility of modifying the original files. For small collections of materials, copying the materials to the processor’s desktop should be sufficient. For larger collections, contact the Digital Archivist for a drive containing the materials that can be used for description. 

The [Born Digital Processing Spreadsheet](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/assets/files/BornDigitalProcessingSpreadsheet.xlsx) will be used to organize information for a collection in preparation for batch upload to ArchivesSpace or simply to coordinate descriptive information for manual input. A blank version of the file should already be present in the Administration folder for a collection.  

Open the [Born Digital Processing Spreadsheet](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/assets/files/BornDigitalProcessingSpreadsheet.xlsx), the copy of the files, the Brunnhilde reports for the processed collection, other donor and collection documentation, and the [PREMIS Spreadsheet](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/assets/files/PREMISSpreadsheet.xlsx) for the collection, the last of which contains a record of all actions conducted during processing. Open the [PREMIS Spreadsheet](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/assets/files/PREMISSpreadsheet.xlsx) for the collection and review the Appraisal events. Follow the general set of actions for each level outlined in the following table:

|     Minimal                                |   The descriptive level for media items is File not Item. This is because born digital media items contain multiple files/items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |   Create Collection level description and Series level description (if applicable).  Create File level description for each media item in the [Born Digital Processing Spreadsheet](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/assets/files/BornDigitalProcessingSpreadsheet.xlsx). Consult the [ArchivesSpace Metadata](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/docs/Born-Digital-Materials/description/#archivesSpace-metadata) section for required metadata and help generating and structuring metadata according to standards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|     Enhanced                               |   The descriptive level for media items is File. The descriptive level for folders in media items is File for folders because they also contain multiple files/items. Note: folders within a media item can be nested within other folders, but we will typically only create an archival object for the highest level of folder and use the scope and contents note to describe the nested contents of a folder unless there is significant user benefit otherwise.   |   Create Collection level description and Series level description (if applicable).  Create File level description for each media item and top and lower level (if applicable) folders in the [Born Digital Processing Spreadsheet](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/assets/files/BornDigitalProcessingSpreadsheet.xlsx). Top level folders should be nested one level “down” from the media item description. Additional nesting should follow the directory structure in the media item. Consult the [ArchivesSpace Metadata](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/docs/Born-Digital-Materials/description/#archivesSpace-metadata) section for required metadata and help generating and structuring metadata according to standards.                                                                                                  |
|     Intensive                              |   The descriptive level for media items is File. The descriptive level for folders in media items is File. The descriptive level for individual files is Item.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |   Create Collection level description and Series level description (if applicable).  Create File level description for each media item and top-level folders in each media item. Top level folders should be nested one level “down” from the media item description. Additional nesting, including for individual files/items, should follow the directory structure in the media item.  Create Item level description for each file on the media item in the [Born Digital Processing Spreadsheet](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/assets/files/BornDigitalProcessingSpreadsheet.xlsx). Consult the [ArchivesSpace Metadata](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/docs/Born-Digital-Materials/description/#archivesSpace-metadata) section for required metadata and help generating and structuring metadata according to standards.  |

If a full file or folder list is necessary for Enhanced or Intensive processing, use the siegfried.csv file (useful purely for file lists) or [WizTree Instructions](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/docs/Born-Digital-Materials/description/#wiztree-instructions) (useful for combined folder and file lists, including size and number of files) to generate a file list for use in the upload.  

Once metadata creation in the [Born Digital Processing Spreadsheet](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/assets/files/BornDigitalProcessingSpreadsheet.xlsx) is complete, create ArchivesSpace archival objects (which correspond to the processing level) as part of the resource record. This may be done easily using the bulk upload process for large quantities of objects. Follow the [information on the ArchivesSpace Help Center](https://archivesspace.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ArchivesSpaceUserManual/pages/1173913646/Import+Archival+Objects+from+Excel+or+CSV+File+from+v2.8.1) (account and ArchivesSpace membership needed) to bulk upload. Send the ArchivesSpace link for the draft, unpublished finding aid to the Accessioning Archivist and/or Head of Archives and Manuscripts pending availability. For hybrid collections, send a copy of the Born Digital Processing Spreadsheet for the collection. Revise the finding aid in response to Accessioning Archivist and/or Head of Archives and Manuscripts feedback.  

Repeat the submission and revision process until finding aid is approved. Publish the finding aid once the finding aid has been approved by the Accessioning Archivist and/or Head of Archives and Manuscripts. Accessioning Archivist and/or Head of Archives and Manuscripts will contact the donor or complete a press release if relevant for the collection based on donor wishes and department priorities.   

## ArchivesSpace Metadata

At the collection and series level, the following information should be used for fully born digital collections. For hybrid collections, defer to the A&M Processing Manual, but be sure to incorporate the following fields outlined here for born digital description: Conditions Governing Access, Conditions Governing Use, Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements, System of Arrangement, and Processing Information:

In addition to the standard archival objects created in ArchivesSpace as part of all archival processing activities, digital archival materials with accessible content (i.e. content must have been retrievable off of the media item) also require digital objects be associated with each archival object that has digital materials. Digital objects may represent a single file, many files, or files in complex multi-level structures. Digital objects should be associated at the file level (I.e. at the media item level) unless more granular access is supported. In the rare case item level information is present, digital objects should be associated at the item level. 

To manually create a digital object in ArchivesSpace attached to the existing archival object for the item, use following instructions: 

1. Navigate to the appropriate Resource record for the collection and Archival Object (folder or item).  
2. Click Edit.  
3. Under Instances, click “Add Digital Object.” 
4. In the Digital Object tab, click “Create.”  
5. In the Digital Object screen, enter the following:  
    * Title: use the same title as the Archival Object 
    * Identifier: Use the identifier for the item (e.g., 4050_disc_001) 
    * Conditions Governing Access: Researchers may access born digital materials by requesting to view the materials in person by appointment or remotely by contacting the West Virginia & Regional History Center reference department at wvrhcref@mail.wvu.edu. (This is for temporary use until we get a digital repository up and running)  
    * Extent:  
        * Portion, select: Whole 
        * Number: Numeric value for quantity of files in GB 
        * Type, select: Gigabytes 
        * Container Summary: format as “1,000 files”, using the number of files for the applicable item 
    * Digital Object Type: choose the appropriate type from the fixed menu 
    * Language: choose the correct language 
    * Date information includes:  
        * Expression, formatted as: YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM, YYYY, undated, or YYYY-YYYY 
        * Date Type, select: Single or Inclusive 
            * For inclusive date types, fill in Begin (the beginning date) and End (the end date) 
        * Label, select: Creation 
    * Agent Links: link the appropriate agent and role (usually creator) 
    * *File Versions – TBD, waiting on digital repository, would support thumbnails etc*
6. Click Save.

## Upload Files to Digital Repository and Link to ArchivesSpace 

*Cannot complete this section yet as the digital repository is still in development by Systems Development.*

*Once an item has been added to the digital repository it must be linked to ArchivesSpace. Note: cannot do this portion of the workflow yet as the digital repository is not operational. Example of process here: [Creating digital objects in ArchivesSpace and Islandora - ArchivesSpace Online Forum 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eX3ryz6TxU&t=2s)*

## Born Digital Description Tools

Examine each media item with the following questions in mind to begin to understand the collection. Each question or questions is mapped to a corresponding field in ArchivesSpace. For a detailed list of required fields at the collection, series, file, and item level, and rules for how to structure those fields see the [ArchivesSpace Metadata](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/docs/Born-Digital-Materials/description/#archivesSpace-metadata) section.  

The below table collects tools and sources of information for the fields used in description that should be used to supply the metadata outlined in the [ArchivesSpace Metadata](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/docs/Born-Digital-Materials/description/#archivesSpace-metadata) section.

Remove the brackets as they are only present for readability. The output.txt file can be saved anywhere but will save, by default, to your current working directory, visible at the beginning of each command line row.

Do these materials match to any series or content within the physical portion of the collection (if applicable)?    |     For file format and frequency of file format occurrence, consult the report.html file in the folder containing the Brunnhilde report for the media item (for minimal processing). The folder is found within the Metadata folder within the Administration folder for a collection. Always use the folder with _processed in the title if it is present. Use the [WizTree Instructions](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/docs/Born-Digital-Materials/description/#wiztree-instructions) (for Intensive or Enhanced processing) if you need access to file format analysis at a folder level.                                                         |

## WizTree Instructions

To generate automated extent lists for materials being processed at the folder level, open WizTree on the digital preservation processing workstation.  

1. Select the folder for the relevant media item from the Born Digital Content folder within a Collection folder using the __Select Folder__ option in the dropdown in the upper left.

2. The left pane shows the available folders or files to examine. The right pane shows statistics about the files, including file types, number of files, and rough size of the total number of files of each type. The right pane is useful for scope and content and other metadata fields.

3. To bulk extract file and folder size and number of files, select __Export to .CSV file...__ The file will export to the folder you opened for examination. This resulting file will contain output information about every file and folder in your selection. Sort the spreadsheet’s __File__ column from largest to smallest. This will sort it so that folders are displayed before individual files. You can then harvest the metadata easily for Enhanced and Intensive processing purposes.
