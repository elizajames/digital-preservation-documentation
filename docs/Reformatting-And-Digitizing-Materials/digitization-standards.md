# Digitization Standards

A full list of digitization standards used for in-house digitization may be found in the [Digitization Standards Document](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/assets/files/DigitzationStandards.docx). The default practice of the WVRHC when conducting in-house digitization is to digitize at the highest possible level supported by available equipment or by the preservation quality outlined in the [Digitization Standards Document](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/assets/files/DigitzationStandards.docx). Vendor supplied digitization should be conducted at the preservation level outlined in the [Digitization Standards Document](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/assets/files/DigitzationStandards.docx). The [Supported Formats and Equipment](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/docs/Reformatting-And-Digitizing-Materials/supported-formats-and-equipment/) section above outlines whether in-house equipment meets preservation or access copy standards.
