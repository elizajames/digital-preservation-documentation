# External Vendor Digitization

Some formats may be digitized outside of the WVRHC due to a lack of equipment, expertise, or other resources. While these projects are usually initiated by the Digital Archivist, upon occasion they may be conducted by others within the WVRHC. All external vendor digitization projects should follow the same general set of steps, with the Digital Archivist being copied on all communication to and from the vendor: 

- Determine whether the vendorâ€™s equipment and processes meet the digitization standards outlined in this document. 
- Inventory the items and request a fixed, legally binding quote for digitizing and post-processing of the materials, including an estimate for the amount of time to complete the project. 
- Determine a funding source to fund the outlined costs. Much of the funding for vendor-based digitization projects comes from specific foundation funds or grant projects.  
- Outline transportation needs in accordance with the format of the materials being digitized and coordinate transportation of the materials.  
    - Note: in recent years, the WVRHC has worked with vendors within driving distance to minimize issues related to tracking, packing, and preservation issues. The vendor of choice has usually been The MediaPreserve, located in Cranberry, PA.  
- If necessary, prior to transporting the materials to the vendor, expand the inventory of the materials being digitized. This inventory should, at a minimum, include the originating collection number, the total number of materials being digitized, the format of the materials, any preservation issues, any relevant identifiers, and a title, whether from the item or devised, for each item. 
    - If the project has not been initiated by the Digital Archivist and is being coordinated by another individual, the inventory and anticipated completion date and contact information for the vendor should be relayed to the Digital Archivist and the head of the relevant collection the materials came from. 
- Once the vendor has notified you that the materials have been digitized, transfer of the resulting digitized files will be done in accordance with the standards outlined earlier in this section for internal digitization projects in consultation with the Digital Archivist. 
- Materials, once received or picked up, will be compared to the inventory list to ensure no items are missing before being returned to their original collection. 
- All invoices should be forwarded to the WVU Libraries Business Planning Office for payment from the relevant funding source.
