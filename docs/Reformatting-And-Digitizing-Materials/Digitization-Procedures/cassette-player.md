## Identification and Introduction
Audio cassettes were a magnetic tape-based recorded sound format composed of magnetic particles or pigment, binder, and a polyester base and were popularly used from the 1970s through the 1990s. The lifespan of a cassette is dependent upon numerous factors: the quality of the original tape, the type and condition of the machine on which it is played, the amount of care the tapes are given, how often they are played, and how they are packaged. Frequent playback wears on the media and degrades the sound quality with each playback.  The projected lifespan of cassette tapes is 10 to 30 years. To learn more about cassette tapes, see the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign's [documentation on the format](https://psap.library.illinois.edu/collection-id-guide/audiotape#compactcassette).

## Digitization Procedures

### Inspect Item for Issues

Because of the age and fragility of the format, it is important to inspect the item for preservation issues before digitizing the item. Follow the checklist below to determine whether there are any issues with the tape that might impact digitization. 

- Examine the cassette for biological contamination. This might include:  
    - __Mold__- Examine the inside of the cassette case and the edges of the tape. Mold can be black, brown, or mustard-colored, and has fuzziness and hair-like growths. If you encounter mold, do not digitize these materials as moldy tapes, when played, can contaminate all other subsequent tapes played. Place the effected media in a plastic bag to quarantine it and reach out to digitizationlab@mail.wvu.edu to determine next steps.  
    - __Pests__- Look for droppings, urine stains, tracks, and gnawing damage. If you encounter evidence of pests, place the effected media in a plastic bag to quarantine it and reach out to digitizationlab@mail.wvu.edu to determine next steps. 
- Examine the cassette for chemical degradation.   
    - Smell the open portion of the cassette case for any odors. Do not breathe in deeply, but instead waft the smell towards your nose by making quick fanning gestures with your hand. If the tape has a waxy, dirty socks, or pungent odor, chemical breakdown has likely occurred. Be sure to monitor these tapes closely while conducting digitization and reach out to digitizationlab@mail.wvu.edu once digitization is complete or any issues are encountered so that the tape heads may be cleaned.  
- Examine the cassette for physical damage.  
    - Tape reel is flaky or there are tape particles inside cassette case 
        - Audio content is encoded on a magnetic tape layer sitting on top of the base tape layer, meaning that any flaking of the top layer results in a loss of content or quality. Be sure to monitor these tapes closely while conducting digitization and reach out to digitizationlab@mail.wvu.edu once digitization is complete or any issues are encountered so that the tape heads may be cleaned. 
    - Cassette tape is damaged 
        - Damage may include a cracked shell, cracked or missing cassette window, and a detached, off center, loose, or missing pressure pad (seen below, view from bottom of cassette tape)

        - All of the above factors may result in a loss of content or tape quality unless the cassette tape case or pressure pad are replaced. The Digitization Lab does not have supplies immediately available to fix this issue, however, please reach out to digitizationlab@mail.wvu.edu so that the Lab can source materials and create procedures for this work in the future. If you choose to move forward with digitization, be sure to monitor these tapes closely while conducting digitization. 
- Reel of tape inside casing is broken, torn, or wound inconsistently or incorrectly 
    - Incorrect or inconsistently wound tape can be corrected by [manually rewinding tape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtLpc_71vtA).  
    - The Digitization Lab does not have supplies available to splice broken audio tape in a way that follows the preservation principles of reversibility and not doing harm to materials in the long-term. Certain methods of splicing tape, such as using standard office tape, are not recommended. These splices can create adhesive residue in the tape player itself causing mechanical damage to the player. Additionally, these splices can damage the tape itself. Please reach out to digitizationlab@mail.wvu.edu so that the Lab can source materials and create procedures for this work in the future.

### Physical Setup

1. Verify that the Roland sound interface and cassette player are plugged in to the surge protector below the desk. The cords are labeled as Roland sound interface and cassette player respectively. Turn on the devices by pressing and briefly holding the power button on the upper right of the Roland sound interface. Turn on the cassette player by pressing the power button in the lower leftâ€”the power button should stay pressed once you let go.    
2. Plug the red and white tipped cords for the cassette player, found hanging on the cubicle wall and labeled with __Cassette Player__, into the Roland sound interface (see image below).
