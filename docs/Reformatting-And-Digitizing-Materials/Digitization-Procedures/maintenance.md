Note: the Digitization Lab does not currently stock the resources needed for in-house equipment or item maintenance should equipment or items need to be repaired.

## Cassette Player

Apply a cotton swab moistened in 99% isopropyl alcohol to the head, being careful not to touch any rubber parts with the alcohol. Rubber parts can be cleaned with a cotton swab or microfibre cloth slightly moistened with water. Ensure there is no lint from the cotton swab left behind on any part of the equipment. It is possible to over-clean, so clean only when necessary. Cassette and reel heads and guides should also be cleaned after playing a particularly problematic tape (one that is showing signs of shedding, squealing, etc.). - [The Digitization of Audiotapes - Technical Bulletin 30 by Joe Iraci, Richard Hess, and Kimberley Flak](https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/conservation-preservation-publications/technical-bulletins/digitization-audio-tapes.html) 

### Cassette Repair

__Felt Repair__: Each cassette has a felt pad to help the tape "touch" the head of the cassette player to be heard. Sometimes these felts fall out. [This Memory Lab Network video demonstrates repair options](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/y6keh/?action=download%26mode=render).

__Recasing Cassettes__: Cassettes may need to be rehoused due to preservation concerns identified in the inspection process. [This Memory Lab Network Video demonstrates recasing options](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/2ze48/?direct%26mode=render%26action=download%26mode=render).

## VHS Player

Cleaning of the tape path may involve the use of wet or dry cleaning cassettes, which can remove some debris on the machine parts. However, these cleaners are abrasive and may damage the video heads. Alternatively, manual cleaning may be performed with a lint-free swab and a suitable cleaning solvent. Whichever method is used, it is imperative to consult the manufacturer’s instructions to avoid damaging the components in the VCR. In addition, cleaning should only be performed by individuals that are experienced in or properly trained in VCR cleaning techniques. The frequency of cleaning is difficult to determine as it depends on the age and cleanliness of the tapes and the playback environment. Older recordings may shed more debris and, therefore, more frequent cleaning may be required than if only newer ones are played. However, it is important not to clean more often than necessary. Regular inspections of the playback unit and taking note of degradation in the video signal are two ways to determine when cleaning is required. - [The Digitization of VHS Videotapes – Technical Bulletin 31 by Joe Iraci](https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/conservation-preservation-publications/technical-bulletins/digitization-vhs-video-tapes.html)

Cleaning procedures are outlined in this Memory Lab Network video. [The video also outlines what to do if a tape is stuck inside the VHS player](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/vkchb/?action=download%26mode=render).

## Computers

### 2-D and 3-D Digitization Station

#### Main Computer

Core programs installed, used in documentation, and added to the desktop include: 

- [Epson Scan](https://epson.com/Support/Scanners/Expression-Series/Epson-Expression-10000XL---Photo/s/SPT_E10000XL-PH)
- [FastStone Image Viewer](https://www.faststone.org/FSViewerDetail.htm)
- [Bulk Rename Utility](https://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/)

Additional links added to the desktop include: 

- Equipment Procedures (seen on this site)
- Report an Issue (internal use in Digitization Lab only)

Maintenance needs may include: 

- Updating the core programs above is support for current versions is outdated. - Update any documentation for equipment that use the software if the software has changed substantially.
- Deleting stray files periodically if necessary.

#### Bookeye Computer

Core programs installed and used in documentation include: 

- [OpusFreeFlow](https://www.dlsg.com/opus-freeflow)

Additional links added to the desktop include: 

- A downloaded Word version of the equipment operations

Maintenance needs may include: 

- Deleting stray files periodically and emptying the recycling bin if necessary. This is especially a concern for the Bookeye computer where files are output to a static location and the computer is non-networked.

### Audio and Video Digitization Station

Core programs installed and used in documentation include: 

- [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)
- [Bulk Rename Utility](https://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/)
- [Elgato Video Capture](https://www.elgato.com/en/video-capture/support)
- [Exact Audio Copy](https://www.exactaudiocopy.de/)
- [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/)
- [VLC Media Player](https://www.videolan.org/)

Programs that are installed for ancillary use if the Elgato Video Capture device is proving to not work with a specific VHS tape: 

- Pinnacle Instant DVD Recorder (from disc in Pinnacle box, not online)
- Pinnacle Studio (from disc in Pinnacle box, not online)

Additional links added to the desktop include: 

- Equipment Procedures (seen here)
- Report an Issue (internal link for WVU employees)

Maintenance needs may include: 

- Updating the core programs above is support for current versions is outdated. Update any documentation for equipment that use the software if the software has changed substantially.
- Deleting stray files periodically if necessary.
