## Digitizing Books and Oversized Flat Items

### Arranging Your Object On The Scan Bed

Center your book on scan bed. Align its text along the red laser line that appears when the scanner is powered on, being sure the item is straight and skewed as minimally as possible.

For books that will not remain open on their own, use the red fabric weights or your hands as necessary. The Bookeye will allow you to edit out your fingertips at a later step if desired.

### Scan Settings

Press the POWER button on the Bookeye scanner. It is located on the right side of the machine's front panel.

Once the scanner has warmed up, open the program on the computer desktop.

Begin by clicking "new object." This will contain the entire scanning project.

In the window that opens, name your project. Keep note of the ID number as it will indicate the project's location in the Active Object Hive folder later on. Then click OK.

Go to the __Full Settings__ tab. Click the __Setup__ button to access the project's scan settings.

Most settings can be left as-is. The most important setting is setting __Document Mode__ to __Flat__ if the object is flat. If digitizing a book or other item that uses the cradle, set to __Book__ or __V-Mode__.

### Scanning

Once the settings are arranged, you may begin scanning. Tap the Scan button in the program, on the scanner front panel, or press the foot pedal on the ground to begin a scan.

Once the Bookeye has completed a scan, you may turn the page of your book (if scanning a book) and press the button again. Each scan will appear in the bottom tray of the program.

Once you have completed scanning all pages or items, you have two options. __A__: If you are satisfied with your scans and do not need further editing, you may proceed to retrieve the files from the Active Object hive. __B__: If you wish to use the program's automatic thumb removal functions or have the program rename the image files for you, you will move to __Image Treatment__ tabs and __Exporting__ tabs.

### Retrieval Option A: Retrieving Files from the Active Object Hive

In Opus Freeflow, close your object. Then close or minimize the program.

Select this icon on the desktop:

The content you created is nested several folders deep. You'll need to go from __ActiveObject Hive/01171/00/001/Your ID Number__. Your ID number may be missing some 0s prior to the start and sometimes end of the folder name. Use the "date modified" information to confirm that those are your files.

Inside of that folder in the "Full Size Images" folder, you can copy and paste the files there into your hard drive or thumb drive. Your scanning project is now complete!

Be sure to take all needed scan files with you after every session. The Digitization Lab cannot guarantee the long-term storage of these files on
the machine.

### Retrieval Option B: Image Treatment and Exporting

Opus Freeflow offers in-program image editing such as __thumb removal__, __skew adjustments__, and __content clipping__. Specifics on each are below, as taken from the official manual.

__Content location__
Using the Content Location function will help the user to include or exclude portions of the image(s) in the content to be preserved. 

Click the ![Deskew and content selection](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/assets/images/digitization/OpusFreeFlowIcon1.png) icon and pages will appear with two boxes on them, one for the left page and one for the right page.

It is important to note that by changing the clip size on one image, all the clips will be set to the same size throughout the object if they are set to be dependent.

To apply the changes, click Perform IT on Current Image or All the Images. The results are displayed in the Export tab for review. To delete a clip, right click anywhere inside the clip. To create a clip, click and drag on the image where the clip is going to be placed. If the image is dependent and the user needs to create a clip, click on the image where the upper-left corner of the clip should be placed and a clip of the predetermined size will be displayed.

__Skew__
Click the icon. Skewed white boxes for the left and right pages will appear with four horizontal green lines each and Move Points at the ends of each line. Move the cursor over one of the Move Points. When it becomes a double arrow , hold down the left mouse key and move up to deskew the page clockwise and down to deskew the page counterclockwise.

Please Note: When deskewing pages, line up the green lines with lines of text or with the bottom or top of an image. This will act as a grid to aid in correctly deskewing the page.
