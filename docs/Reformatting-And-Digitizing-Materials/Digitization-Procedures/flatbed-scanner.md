## Preparing your Item For Scanning

Flatbed scanners require items to be placed face-down on the document table.

Ensure the scanner table is clear of dust before placing your item.

## Program Settings

Turn on the scanner using the power button. 

__IMG GO HERE__

To access the scanner program, select the Epson Scan icon on the work station’s desktop.

__IMG GO HERE__

The computer will launch the scanner program in Professional Mode. If it launches in Auto or Home Mode, you can select Professional mode in the top right of the window.

__IMG GO HERE__

### Original Section

Select setting that matches the item you are scanning.

For Reflective items, choose between photo or document.

__IMG GO HERE__

### Destination Section

Select your project resolution. Check our digitization standards sheet for information on which DPI (“dots per inch”)  is ideal for your project.

We recommend leaving Image Type as 24-bit Color to preserve as much of the original image as possible with no overcorrection from the program.

__IMG GO HERE__

### Adjustments Section

Options for the scanner to correct the image in post-production.

These options are unnecessary for most scanning and can be left unselected if unsure.
