This guide covers the Epson 10000XL for scanning Reflective items - defined by the Epson Scan software as documents and photos. Light does not pass through these items as it does on translucent items such as film.

__Hardware__: [Epson Expression 10000XL](https://files.support.epson.com/pdf/ex10kg/ex10kgu1.pdf) (under 11x17in)

__Software__: Epson Scan

## Preparing your Item For Scanning

Flatbed scanners require items to be placed face-down on the document table.

Ensure the scanner table is clear of dust before placing your item.

Turn on the scanner using the power button.

## Program Settings

To access the scanner program, select the Epson Scan icon on the work station’s desktop.

The computer will launch the scanner program in Professional Mode. If it launches in Auto or Home Mode, you can select Professional mode in the top right of the window.

### Original Section

Select setting that matches the item you are scanning.

For Reflective items, choose between photo or document.

### Destination Section

Select your project resolution. Check our [Digitization Standards Document](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/docs/Appendices/appendix2/#digitization-standards-document) for information on which DPI (“dots per inch”)  is ideal for your project.

We recommend leaving Image Type as 24-bit Color to preserve as much of the original image as possible with no overcorrection from the program.

### Adjustments Section

Options for the scanner to correct the image in post-production.

These options are unnecessary for most scanning and can be left unselected if unsure.

## Scanning

### Previewing Your Scan

Pressing the __Preview__ button will initiate a quick scan on the scan bed. The Preview window will open.

From the official user guide:

To select your scan area, click the auto locate icon (shaped like a green square with two black arrows pointed toward it) to place a marquee that marks the edges of your image area. You can move the marquee to change the scan area.

To zoom in on an image, click inside the scan area and click the Zoom button. EPSON Scan prescans again and displays a larger preview on the __Zoom__ tab. (Your other images are still previewed at the original size on the Preview tab.)

You can move the marquee, adjust its size, and create multiple marquees on one image to scan different image areas in separate scan files. 

### Scan

Press "Scan" to begin the scan. The file will be saved to your selected folder.
