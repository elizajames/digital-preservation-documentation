# Description

For items that are going to be made publicly available and uploaded to the relevant section of WVU Digital Collections, metadata is assigned according to the metadata profile in Appendix 3. Description may be completed at the item, folder, or collection level as determined by the [Digitization Project Planning document](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/assets/files/DigitizationPlanningForm.docx) for the collection being digitized.  

Metadata may be input directly into the WVRHC digital repository or, in the case of collections where materials may benefit from batch uploading, can be input into the Digital Repository Metadata Spreadsheet.  

If an item is only being digitized for a reference request, the metadata implicit in the file name outlined in the File Naming Conventions section is sufficient.
