# Description

For items that are going to be made publicly available and uploaded to the relevant section of WVU Digital Collections, metadata is assigned according to the metadata profile in [Appendix 3](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/docs/Appendices/appendix3/). Description may be completed at the item, folder, or collection level as determined by the [Digitization Project Planning document](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/assets/files/DigitizationPlanningForm.docx) for the collection being digitized.  

Metadata may be input directly into the WVRHC digital repository or, in the case of collections where materials may benefit from batch uploading, can be input into the [Digital Repository Metadata Spreadsheet](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/assets/files/Digital_Repository_Metadata_Template.xlsx).  

If an item is only being digitized for a reference request, the metadata implicit in the file name outlined in the [File Naming Conventions](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/docs/Reformatting-And-Digitizing-Materials/digitization-workflows/#file-naming-conventions) section is sufficient. 

## Upload to Digital Repository and Link to ArchivesSpace 

_Cannot complete the upload portion of this section yet as the digital repository is still in development by Systems Development._ 

_Relevant sections: metadata in [Appendix 3](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/docs/Appendices/appendix3/)_ 

_Once an item has been added to the digital repository it must be linked to ArchivesSpace—cannot do this portion of the workflow yet as the digital repository is not operational. Example of process here:  [Creating digital objects in ArchivesSpace and Islandora - ArchivesSpace Online Forum 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eX3ryz6TxU&t=2s)_

Initial ArchivesSpace instructions so that users know what items we have digitized: 

For audiovisual materials with digitized versions, create a digital object in ArchivesSpace attached to the existing archival object containing digitized material using the following instructions: 

1. Navigate to the appropriate Resource record for the collection and Archival Object (folder or item).  
2. Click Edit.  
3. Under Instances, click "Add Digital Object." 
4. In the Digital Object tab, click "Create."  
5. In the Digital Object screen, enter the following (bolded fields are mandatory):  
    * __Title__: use the same title as the Archival Object 
    * __Identifier__: Use the base file name minus the file extension (e.g., 4050_vhs_001) 
    * __Conditions Governing Access__: Researchers may access digitized materials by requesting to view the materials in person by appointment or remotely by contacting the West Virginia & Regional History Center reference department at wvrhcref@mail.wvu.edu. (This is for temporary use until we get a digital repository up and running)

        * Number: Numeric value for quantity of files in GB 
        * Type, select: Gigabytes
