The WVRHC emphasizes making materials as accessible as possible given privacy, legal, ethical, cultural, copyright, and other relevant considerations. The WVRHC upholds the privacy and safety of individuals who create or are mentioned in the archival collections it holds. Materials with private and personally identifiable information will be redacted in the digital repository with original files accessible on-site only. Access is primarily supported through the digital repository unless restrictions require on-site access only. Materials in the digital repository will be linked to the original material described in ArchivesSpace and vice versa.  

Digitized materials in collections will, by default, be made accessible to varying degrees via the digital repository based on copyright, privacy, legal, and donor considerations. Given those considerations, digital materials may be made freely available via the digital repository if:  

- The materials are in the public domain (be it through expiration of copyright or Creative Commons Licensing on behalf of the donor) 
- Permission is secured from the copyright holder 
- Copyright has been transferred to the WVRHC 
- Materials may be made accessible via Section 108 of copyright law 
- The items have no determinable copyright holder and the works are "orphaned" 
    - Copyright evaluations for materials determined to be "orphaned" should be saved on the Z: drive in the folder for a collection. Copyright evaluations should be conducted by the Digital Archivist or an authorized entity. 

Materials will only be made available to all individuals who are logged in to the repository and have completed a digital content usage agreement if:  

- The materials are under copyright and no Section 108 exemption supporting open access applies 
- The materials required significant redaction  
- The deed of gift or other documentation related to the acquisition of the materials is unclear about whether the WVRHC has permission to make these materials widely digitally available 

Materials will only be made available to specific individuals who are logged in to the repository, have completed a digital content usage agreement, and have completed any other relevant forms if: 

- The materials are restricted and require additional special permissions based on donor agreements 

Materials will be made available on-site if:  

- The materials are redacted in the digital repository and the original is requested 
- Users would like to view materials that require a log-in to the repository 
- Donor or copyright restrictions require in-person only access 

## On-Site Only Access 

For on-site access, reference staff should contact the Digital Archivist with the ArchivesSpace link to the materials being requested and the date the patron would like to use the materials.  

*Materials will be made accessible using the reading room computer. Additional details to come pending discussions with Systems Infrastructure.*

## Access File Creation 

Materials digitized at preservation quality generate files that are larger than usually used by most individuals. Some files may need to have access copies generated. Guidelines for consistent production of access copies for various formats of digitized materials may be found in the [Digitization Standards Document](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/assets/files/DigitzationStandards.docx). 

The digital repository houses preservation files for all image-based and audio materials and access files only for video materials due to size limitations. Individuals who need original preservation quality files for video materials may contact the Digital Archivist. Access files will be generated using the Handbrake software prior to uploading to the digital repository. 

## Takedown Policy 

The WVRHC Takedown Policy is posted on the WVRHC digital repository. The text of the Takedown Policy is included here:  

{: .takedown policy}
>The West Virginia & Regional History Center (WVRHC) makes digital collections available online for educational and scholarly use. When making this content available, the WVRHC makes every effort to verify that the WVRHC has the appropriate rights and permissions to provide online access to these materials and identifies and redacts sensitive information from materials that may threaten the privacy and security of individuals, organizations, or other entities. 
>
>If you are concerned that making these materials available online violates your copyright, privacy, or security, please submit a request for removal to elizabeth.james1@mail.wvu.edu. Please include a link to the work that you feel is being made inappropriately available. All such requests will be reviewed carefully by the WVRHC and removals will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Materials will be removed from public view until a determination is made. 

If the WVRHC is contacted and requested to take down an item, suppress the digital file from being visible to the public in the digital repository. The procedures for how to suppress a file, but not the overall record, are in the Digital Repository Procedures document. The metadata record describing the item will not be suppressed as it simply indicates to patrons that a digital version of the item is available for use.
