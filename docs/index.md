# West Virginia and Regional History Center Documentation
## For all things digital and audiovisual at the WVRHC.

This site outlines procedures, principles, and standards used for accessioning, appraising, ingesting, processing, describing, stewarding, preserving, digitizing, and making accessible, digitized and born digital special collections and archival materials at the West Virginia and Regional History Center. It is used as a manual by various WVRHC employees and was first completed in October 2022 by Elizabeth James, Digital Archivist at the WVRHC, and added to Github in November 2022. 

### Documentation Principles
Digital archives work is done through a series of decisions and actions, made by humans over time and guided by principles, that coalesce into an approach for stewarding these formats and types and materials. Digital archives work emphasizes:  

- _Collaboration_ within the department and with Systems and Information Technology groups to accomplish program goals. 
- _Responsibility_ for materials and the individuals documented within our collections.
- _Usability_ of our materials by people in the short and long term. 

In addition to these more abstract working principles, we also seek to adhere to the following principles for efficient processing and management of material, as recommended by the now ubiquitous [_Guidelines for Efficient Archival Processing in the University of California Libraries_](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4b81g01z):

- Aim to provide access to all holdings. 
- Always look for the "golden minimum." 
- Analyze the work necessary for every collection and be flexible in the amount of work applied. 
- Arrange, describe, and preserve materials in harmony. 
- Measure and compare processing rates to ensure processing is carried out efficiently.
