# Storage and Backups

Storage and backups of the preservation storage environment for the WVRHC is done by WVU Libraries Systems Infrastructure. The Digital Archivist works with Systems Infrastructure to document current configurations and changes to the storage environment. This includes communicating and collaboratively planning all server migrations a minimum of one year ahead of a full system upgrade or move and working together to perform quality checks on servers and backup needed using manual and automated techniques as needed.  

The Z:\ portion of the shared drive is located on a physical server on-premise at the Downtown Library. All changes to the server are replicated instantaneously to a second server at the Health Sciences Library. Scheduled snapshots of Z:\ occur every day in the evening. These snapshots are retained for three months before being deleted. The same structure of replication exists for MFCS. MFCS is also snapshot every thirty minutes. Should the Downtown Library server fail, the Health Sciences Library servers will be activated as the primary server within fifteen minutes. In the event of power failure, the Downtown Library server is supported by generator power.
