# Annual Review

A key component of an active digital preservation program is periodic review of the collections to check for bit-rot by verifying fixity of preservation files and reviewing existing practices to incorporate new developments in the field. An annual review of existing practices includes reviewing this manual and ancillary documentation, updating relevant sections as needed. An annual review will also be conducted on the physical hardware to ensure functionality, particularly for little-used hardware. Fixity may be verified annually for each collection by validating the collection’s “bag” created using [BagIt](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/bagit-python). The exact script used may vary depending on the exact nature or purpose of the fixity check. Currently, fixity checks are only run on the backlog and archives and manuscripts files found on the Z:/ drive.
