# Continuity Planning and Roles and Responsibilities

Currently, due to the nascent nature of the digital preservation program and the lack of available resources, there are no redundant or backup individuals who can conduct the same work as the Digital Archivist. However, the documentation in this manual supports the operation of the program at a minimal level by other staff on an ad hoc basis.  

Regardless, it is helpful to examine the roles and responsibilities of individuals within the larger WVU Libraries and WVRHC groupings to see who is responsible for the various areas that intersect with the work covered within this manual.
